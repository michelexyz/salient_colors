\section{Conclusion}\label{s:conclusion}

In this research we have explored the influence of colour on the saliency of football players. Motivated by the real-life relevance in football, we have focused on one specific interpretation of saliency, namely relative majority in a scene. We have formulated a specific research questions, we asked if subjects' ability to identify the majority team depends on the jersey colour of the majority team. We picked red and blue because they are commonly used in football and commonly studied in related cognitive psychology research. Our experimental results clearly show a noticeable and significant effect of jersey colour on subject accuracy. Our subject reported blue as the majority team significantly more so than they did red. While the cognitive mechanisms explaining our results warrant further investigation, the experimental results are difficult to refute.
